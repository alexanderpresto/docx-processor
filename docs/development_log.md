# Development Log

This document provides a formal record of the docx-processor development process.

> **Note**: This project uses Basic-Memory for semantic knowledge management. Detailed development insights, bug fixes, and architectural decisions are documented in the Basic-Memory knowledge graph under the "dev" project. Use `search_notes("docx-processor topic")` to find related information.

## Version History

### v0.1.0 (2025-03-15)

Initial alpha release with core functionality:

- Document structure extraction
- Image extraction and optimization
- Table extraction with CSV export
- HTML preview generation

## Development Journal

### 2025-03-20: Project Initialization

- Established core project structure with main modules
- Created GitHub repository at https://github.com/alexanderpresto/docx-processor
- Set up documentation framework including:
  - README.md with basic usage information
  - JOURNAL.md for tracking development decisions
  - docs/ directory for formal documentation

### Architectural Decisions

#### Document Processing Approach

The project uses python-mammoth as the core DOCX parsing library due to its:
- Reliable document structure extraction
- Built-in image handling capabilities
- Active maintenance and community support

#### Code Organization

- Core functionality is modularized into focused Python modules:
  - processor.py: Main document processing logic
  - image_handler.py: Image extraction and optimization
  - html_generator.py: HTML preview generation
- This approach improves maintainability and testing

## Planned Enhancements

1. Unit test implementation (Priority: High)
2. Document styles extraction (Priority: Medium)
3. Complex table handling improvements (Priority: Medium)
4. Web interface for document uploads (Priority: Low)
