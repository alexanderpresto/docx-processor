## Development Journal

### 2025-01-22: v2.0 Phase 1 Implementation - Intelligent Chunking

**Major Milestone**: Successfully implemented the first major feature for v2.0 - intelligent document chunking system.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Created comprehensive `DocumentChunker` class with token-based splitting
- Integrated tiktoken for accurate AI model token counting with fallback support
- Implemented configurable chunk sizes and overlap for context preservation
- Added natural boundary detection to respect document structure
- Enhanced CLI with new chunking parameters
- Maintained full backward compatibility with v0.1.0

**Technical Decisions:**
- Chose tiktoken for GPT-4/Claude compatibility with graceful fallback
- Implemented overlap-based context preservation (default 200 tokens)
- Used natural boundary detection to avoid splitting mid-sentence
- Created separate JSON output for AI consumption while preserving existing formats

**Testing Results:**
- Comprehensive testing showed proper chunk creation with metadata
- Token counting verified against tiktoken standards
- Natural boundary detection working correctly
- Section-aware chunking preserves document hierarchy

**Files Modified/Created:**
- NEW: `src/docx_processor/chunking.py` - Core chunking functionality
- ENHANCED: `src/docx_processor/processor.py` - Chunking integration
- ENHANCED: `src/docx_processor/cli.py` - New CLI options
- ENHANCED: `main.py` - Updated with chunking parameters
- UPDATED: `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml` - Version and dependencies
- NEW: `examples/chunking_example.py` - Demonstration script

**Next Phase**: Enhanced metadata extraction (Phase 2) ready to begin.

### 2025-06-22: v2.0 Phase 2 Implementation - Enhanced Metadata Extraction

**Major Milestone**: Successfully completed Phase 2 of v2.0 development - comprehensive metadata and style extraction system.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Created comprehensive `MetadataExtractor` class with full document property extraction
- Implemented `StyleExtractor` class for document style and formatting analysis
- Enhanced CLI with new parameters: `--extract-metadata`, `--extract-styles`, `--include-comments`
- Extended processor.py with Phase 2 integration while maintaining backward compatibility
- Added robust error handling with graceful degradation for missing metadata

**Technical Achievements:**
- Multi-source metadata extraction from core.xml, app.xml, custom.xml, and comments.xml
- Style analysis including fonts, colors, layout, headers/footers, and usage statistics
- Direct XML parsing with namespace support for comprehensive data access
- Modular design ready for Phase 3 API integration
- Enhanced output structure with separate JSON files for metadata and styles

**Testing Results:**
- Comprehensive test suite created with 5/5 tests passing
- Module-level testing for MetadataExtractor and StyleExtractor classes
- CLI integration verification and processor parameter validation
- Error handling and graceful degradation testing completed

**Files Created/Modified:**
- NEW: `src/docx_processor/metadata_extractor.py` - Core metadata functionality
- NEW: `src/docx_processor/style_extractor.py` - Style analysis functionality
- NEW: `test_phase2.py` - Comprehensive Phase 2 test suite
- ENHANCED: `src/docx_processor/processor.py` - Phase 2 integration
- ENHANCED: `src/docx_processor/cli.py` - New CLI options
- ENHANCED: `main.py` - Updated parameter passing
- UPDATED: `requirements.txt` - Added python-docx dependency

**Output Enhancements:**
- New `metadata.json` file with comprehensive document properties
- New `styles.json` file with style and formatting analysis
- New `comments.json` file (when --include-comments used)
- Enhanced `document_structure.json` with metadata and style summaries
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing output formats

**Phase 2 Success Criteria Met:**
- âœ… All document properties accessible via CLI
- âœ… Comments extracted with positional context
- âœ… Style information mapped to document structure
- âœ… No performance regression for basic operations
- âœ… Backward compatibility maintained
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage implemented

**Next Phase**: API Framework and AI Service Integration (Phase 3) ready to begin.

### 2025-03-20: Project Initialization

- Established core project structure with main modules
- Created GitHub repository at https://github.com/alexanderpresto/docx-processor
- Set up documentation framework including:
  - README.md with basic usage information
  - JOURNAL.md for tracking development decisions
  - docs/ directory for formal documentation

### Architectural Decisions

#### Document Processing Approach

The project uses python-mammoth as the core DOCX parsing library due to its:
- Reliable document structure extraction
- Built-in image handling capabilities
- Active maintenance and community support

#### Code Organization

- Core functionality is modularized into focused Python modules:
  - processor.py: Main document processing logic
  - image_handler.py: Image extraction and optimization
  - html_generator.py: HTML preview generation
- This approach improves maintainability and testing

## Planned Enhancements

1. Unit test implementation (Priority: High)
2. Document styles extraction (Priority: Medium)
3. Complex table handling improvements (Priority: Medium)
4. Web interface for document uploads (Priority: Low)
