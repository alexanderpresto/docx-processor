## Version History

### v2.0.0-alpha (2025-01-22)

Major upgrade with AI-focused features:

**âœ¨ NEW: Intelligent Document Chunking System**
- Token-based document splitting for AI model compatibility
- Configurable chunk sizes (default: 2000 tokens) with context overlap
- Natural boundary detection respecting paragraphs and sentences
- Comprehensive metadata for each chunk including position and relationships
- tiktoken integration for accurate GPT-4/Claude token counting

**Enhanced CLI Interface:**
- `--enable-chunking`: Toggle intelligent chunking functionality
- `--max-chunk-tokens`: Configure maximum tokens per chunk
- `--chunk-overlap`: Set overlap for context preservation

**Output Enhancements:**
- New `document_chunks.json` file with AI-ready text segments
- Chunk summary with statistics and boundary information
- Backward compatibility with v0.1.0 output formats

**Dependencies Added:**
- tiktoken>=0.5.0 for accurate token counting

**Architecture Improvements:**
- New `chunking.py` module with DocumentChunker class
- Enhanced processor.py with chunking integration
- Modular design ready for Phase 2 enhancements

### v0.1.0 (2025-03-15)

Initial alpha release with core functionality:

- Document structure extraction
- Image extraction and optimization
- Table extraction with CSV export
- HTML preview generation

## Development Journal

### 2025-01-22: v2.0 Phase 1 Implementation - Intelligent Chunking

**Major Milestone**: Successfully implemented the first major feature for v2.0 - intelligent document chunking system.

**Implementation Highlights:**
- Created comprehensive `DocumentChunker` class with token-based splitting
- Integrated tiktoken for accurate AI model token counting with fallback support
- Implemented configurable chunk sizes and overlap for context preservation
- Added natural boundary detection to respect document structure
- Enhanced CLI with new chunking parameters
- Maintained full backward compatibility with v0.1.0

**Technical Decisions:**
- Chose tiktoken for GPT-4/Claude compatibility with graceful fallback
- Implemented overlap-based context preservation (default 200 tokens)
- Used natural boundary detection to avoid splitting mid-sentence
- Created separate JSON output for AI consumption while preserving existing formats

**Testing Results:**
- Comprehensive testing showed proper chunk creation with metadata
- Token counting verified against tiktoken standards
- Natural boundary detection working correctly
- Section-aware chunking preserves document hierarchy

**Files Modified/Created:**
- NEW: `src/docx_processor/chunking.py` - Core chunking functionality
- ENHANCED: `src/docx_processor/processor.py` - Chunking integration
- ENHANCED: `src/docx_processor/cli.py` - New CLI options
- ENHANCED: `main.py` - Updated with chunking parameters
- UPDATED: `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml` - Version and dependencies
- NEW: `examples/chunking_example.py` - Demonstration script

**Next Phase**: Enhanced metadata extraction (Phase 2) ready to begin.

### 2025-03-20: Project Initialization

- Established core project structure with main modules
- Created GitHub repository at https://github.com/alexanderpresto/docx-processor
- Set up documentation framework including:
  - README.md with basic usage information
  - JOURNAL.md for tracking development decisions
  - docs/ directory for formal documentation

### Architectural Decisions

#### Document Processing Approach

The project uses python-mammoth as the core DOCX parsing library due to its:
- Reliable document structure extraction
- Built-in image handling capabilities
- Active maintenance and community support

#### Code Organization

- Core functionality is modularized into focused Python modules:
  - processor.py: Main document processing logic
  - image_handler.py: Image extraction and optimization
  - html_generator.py: HTML preview generation
- This approach improves maintainability and testing

## Planned Enhancements

1. Unit test implementation (Priority: High)
2. Document styles extraction (Priority: Medium)
3. Complex table handling improvements (Priority: Medium)
4. Web interface for document uploads (Priority: Low)
