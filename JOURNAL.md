# docx-processor Project Journal

A chronological record of key development decisions, challenges, and progress for the docx-processor project.

## 2025-03-20: Project Initialization and Repository Setup

- Established initial project structure with core modules:
  - `processor.py`: Main document processing logic
  - `image_handler.py`: Image extraction and optimization
  - `html_generator.py`: HTML preview generation
- Defined dependency requirements with specific versions
- Created command-line interface with support for basic configuration options
- Implemented initial feature set:
  - Document structure extraction based on headers
  - Image extraction with optimization options
  - Table extraction with CSV export option
  - HTML preview generation
- Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/alexanderpresto/docx-processor
- Released version 0.1.0 with basic functionality

## 2025-03-20: Documentation Framework Implementation

- Established project documentation structure:
  - Created `JOURNAL.md` in root directory for tracking development decisions and progress
  - Updated `README.md` to reference project documentation resources
  - Created `docs/` directory for formal documentation
  - Added `docs/development_log.md` with formal development history, architectural decisions, and enhancement plans
- Documented architectural decisions including:
  - Selection of python-mammoth as core DOCX parsing library
  - Modular code organization approach
  - Image processing strategy

## 2025-03-30: Python Environment Migration and Dependency Updates

- Migrated from Anaconda to standard Python virtual environment
- Updated dependency management:
  - Corrected package name from `python-mammoth` to `mammoth`
  - Updated mammoth to latest version (1.9.0)
  - Resolved Pillow compatibility issues with newer Python versions (>=10.0.0)
  - Updated lxml dependency to use pre-compiled wheels (>=5.0.0)
- Dependencies now correctly specified for standard pip installation
- Verified proper installation process with virtual environment for cross-platform compatibility
- Updated documentation with installation instructions for standard Python environments

## 2025-03-30: Improved Path Handling and Installation Options

- Addressed issue with running docx-processor from outside project directory:
  - Modified `main.py` to handle absolute paths for input and output files
  - Added path resolution logic to ensure proper file access regardless of execution directory
  - Created `__main__.py` for package execution via `python -m src`
- Created proper installation options:
  - Improved documentation for development mode installation with `pip install -e .`
  - Addressed file permission issues when accessing files from other directories
  - Enhanced error handling to provide better feedback for access permission problems
- Documented troubleshooting steps for common installation and execution issues:
  - Permission errors
  - File access problems
  - Python environment configuration

## Next Steps

- Implement unit tests for core functionality
- Add support for document styles extraction
- Improve table handling for complex layouts
- Consider adding a simple web interface for document uploads
